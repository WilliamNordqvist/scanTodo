# ScanTodoApp

This is a project I created for fun just to try out the html5-qrcode. 
The idea with the todo app is that you can scan a barcode and add the product to your todolist.
Other secondary features is that: 
* You can add Ica recipes and create a list based on the recipe.
* You can get the recipe instructions and follow it step by step. 
* Store you favourite recipes and re-use them or modify it to a new list. 
* You can change you own color theme on the list. 

The Backend is build with firebase realtimedata.

To run the project locally run `yarn` and then `yarn start`. The open http://localhost:3000/
